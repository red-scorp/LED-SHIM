# LED-SHIM project

LED-SHIM (mini-HAT), RGB LED array for Raspberry Pi.

Sometimes it's nice to add some shine to your Pi.
This can be achieved with a line or matrix of RGB addressable LEDs.
Welcome to a new shiny world!

Some useful links:

- [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz/) - a brilliant resource on topic of Pi's pinout and HATs.
